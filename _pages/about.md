I was once a game designer and creator working in the game industry, and now a PhD student at the University of Tokyo. Currently I am a visiting researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, working on interactive and differentiable deformable simulation.

I am specialized in interactive and real-time physics simulation for deformable bodies and character animation, with strong hands-on experience in C++, CUDA, PyTorch, NVIDIA Warp. I've been actively working on bridging high-fidelity physics simulation with real-time, interactive applications, including character animation, physics-integrated creation pipelines, and differentiable physics.
