Be original, be effective.

Be the most interesting one.

没有天生的擅长，只有一成不变的熟练

Repetation is the mother of learning.

Know what you're doing, keep that in mind all the time.

Find simplest solution for simple questions, so we'll have time for real problems.

Fail quickly.

It's way easier to be complicated than to be simple.

There's no need to use complecity to prove you're smart or to show off the amount of work. Actually, it's good and efficient to be stupid.

Simpliest Method: Do the simpliest, try improve a little.

If you are already as clever as you can be when you do something, how can you improve?

Complex inside, simple outside.
