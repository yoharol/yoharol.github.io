Prerequisite: Knowledge about mechanics of materials([helpful link](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheEfficientEngineer/videos?view=0&sort=dd&flow=grid))

Elastic materials are important because:

- Cool visual effects
- Not too hard to implement
- Base of other materials

Deformation: A mapping function from rest material position to deformed material position.

Deformation gradient **F**:

Deform/rest volume ratio $J=det(\textbf{F})$

Hyperelastic materials: materials whose stress-strain relationship is defined by a **strain energy density function**. 

- Stress: Internal elastic forces to let material resotre original shape.
- Strain: Just replace it with deformation gradients **F** for now.

Linear tetrahedral(triangle) FEM

affine transform

F is constant within an element
