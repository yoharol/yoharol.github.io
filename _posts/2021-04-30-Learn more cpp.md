title: "Note: More C++"

I've been using C++ for 10 years, but there are still many high-level features that I've never used. This document is a record of those features that I may not use them very often, but essential for a professional C++ programmer.

# Comparison to C

```cpp
    sizeof('c') == sizeof(chear) == 1
//In C++, character literals are chars 
```
