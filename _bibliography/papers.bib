abstract = {Abstract We propose BlendSim, a novel framework for editable simulation using spacetime optimization on the lightweight animation representation. Traditional spacetime control methods suffer from a high computational complexity, which limits their use in interactive animation. The proposed approach effectively reduces the dimensionality of the problem by representing the motion trajectories of each vertex using continuous parametric Bézier splines with variable keyframe times. Because this mesh animation representation is continuous and fully differentiable, it can be optimized such that it follows the laws of physics under various constraints. The proposed method also integrates constraints, such as collisions and cyclic motion, making it suitable for real-world applications where seamless looping and physical interactions are required. Leveraging projective dynamics, we further enhance the computational efficiency by decoupling the optimization into local parallelizable and global quadratic steps, enabling a fast and stable simulation. In addition, BlendSim is compatible with modern animation workflows and file formats, such as the glTF, making it practical way for authoring and transferring mesh animation.},

abstract = {Skinning transformations enable digital characters to be animated with minimal user input. Physics simulations can improve the detailed dynamic movement of an animated character; however, such details are typically added in the post-processing stage after the overall animation is specified. We propose a novel interactive framework that unifies skinning transformations and kinematic simulations using position-based dynamics (PBD). Our framework allows an arbitrarily skinned character to be partially manipulated by the user, and a kinematic physics solver automatically complements the behavior of the entire character. This is achieved by introducing new steps into the PBD algorithm: (i) lightweight optimization to identify the skinning transformations, which is similar to inverse kinematics, and (ii) a position-based constraint to restrict the PBD solver to the complementary subspace of the skinning deformation. Our method combines the best of the two methods: the controllability and shape preservation of the skinning transformation, and the efficiency, simplicity, and unconditional stability of the PBD solver. Our interface allows novices to create vibrant animations without tedious editing.},
